You see, back in those days, rich men would ride around in Zeppelins, dropping coins on people.
One day I seen JD Rockefeller flying by.
So I run of the house with a big washtub.
I'd just used it that morning to wash my turkey, which in those days was known as a walking-bird.
We'd always have walking-bird on Thanksgiving, with all the trimmings: cranberries, injun eyes, yams stuffed with gunpowder.
Then we'd all watch football, which in those days was called baseball.
