When we wanted to see a moving picture, we had take a picture and wave it around; make it flap around in the wind.
Potatoes for beakfast and dinner.
We had to wear shirts on our legs.
If we wanted music, we had to carry our upright miniature organs around with us.
Well, I guess that is still a problem.
