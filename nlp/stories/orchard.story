Once when I was a young lad, we didn't have no fancy supermarkets.
So whenwever I needed food, I had to either grow or steal it.
But, at the time the Yanks took all my crops, so I found an orchard.
And it had the tastiest peaches you have ever seen.
I ate all the peaches in the orchard.
And that farmer was so mad he chased me all the way to Australia and back!
